% 6A. Abstract in English

\abstract{
Design students are often engaged with future contexts, as design education encourages them to explore different contexts and understand the implications of their activities. These explorations are done in what is called a fuzzy front-end in design, which stands for the chaotic but fruitful early phase of a design process. There are different apporaches used by design students to conduct research and increase immersion into the context in this phase. Approaches such as design scenarios, make use of fictional information in addition to factual, in order to increase immersion into context and help design students generate inferential insights. This creates both epistemological and practical challenges in terms of how to define and utilize fiction within the early phases of design. This study draws from the existing literature to utilize world building in this phase. Through action research, three workshops were conducted with design students to generate a theoretical model for presenting how world building is utilized in design education, contributing to the design literature. Furthermore, the toolset devised for use in these workshops is iterated throughout the study based on the insights from the theoretical model, and is presented as a practical contribution to the design education literature. Based on the results, this study presents a case for how world building in design education is carried out in waves of speculation for creating textual reference worlds, and assessment for comparing these speculations with actuality through pragmatic concerns.

% 6B. Turkish Abstract

\oz{
Tasarım eğitimi, öğrencilerin farklı bağlamları keşfetmesi ve üretimlerinin bu bağlamları nasıl etkileyebileceğini düşünebilmeleri için onları sıklıkla gelecek bağlamları ile ilgili çalışmaya itmektedir. Bu keşifler tasarımın belirsiz önyüzü de denilen, kaotik fakat üretken bir erken tasarım sürecinde gerçekleşmektedirler. Bu süreçte tasarım öğrencileri pek çok farklı yöntemden faydalanarak araştırma yapar ve önceden tanımadıkları bağlamların içine girmeyi hedeflerler. Bu yöntemlerden biri olan tasarım senaryoları, gerçek bilgilerden olduğu kadar kurgusal bilgilerden de faydalanır. Bu sayede öğrenciler bağlamların daha çok içine girerek dolaylı çıkarımlar yapabilirler. Bu durum, kurgunun tasarımdaki tanımı ve yeri ile ilgili epistemolojik ve pratik sorunları beraberinde getirir. Bu tez, mevcut literatürden faydalanarak söz konusu erken aşamayı bir dünya kurgulama yöntemi olarak tanımlıyor. Tez kapsamında eylem araştırması ile üç çalıştay gerçekleştirilmiş ve sonuç olarak ortaya tasarım eğitiminde dünya kurgulamanın nasıl kullanıldığına dair bir teorik model çıkartılarak tasarım literatürüne katkı sağlanmıştır. Bununla birlikte, çalıştaylarda kullanılan araç seti, çalışma boyunca geliştirilmiş ve son hali ile tasarım eğitimi literatürüne katkı olarak sunulmuştur. Tezin sonucunda tasarım eğitiminde dünya kurgulamanın, önce metinsel referans dünyalarını yaratan spekülasyonlar, sonra da bunları asli dünyadaki pragmatik endişelerle karşılayan değerlendirmeler arasındaki dalgalanmalar olarak tasviri öne sürülmüştür.

%USEFUL TOOLS

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A. Section referencing within text:

% New reference command for section references with full section number and heading. E.g. for "Section 5.2 Design", write \fullref{sec:ws1-design} in which the argument is your label for the linked section. \literef{sec:ws1-design} produces "5.1, p.XX". You can customize your own custom in-text referencing system here.
\newcommand*{\fullref}[1]{\hyperref[{#1}]{\ref*{#1} \nameref*{#1}}}
\newcommand*{\literef}[1]{\hyperref[{#1}]{\ref*{#1}, p.\pageref*{#1}}}

% B. Original quotes section in the Appendix
%All endnotes specified in your chapters, using \endnote{...} command, will be put in a seperate Appendix with the title specified below. This way you can put the the original language version of any quotes you want. An example is given in the sample chapters. Remove the \input{appendices/Appendix-OriginalQuotes.tex} line from the chapters list below if not using.

\DeclareInstance{enotez-list}{custom}{paragraph} {
	notes-sep = \baselineskip,
	format = \normalfont,
	number = \normalfont{[#1]}
}

\setenotez{
	backref=true,
