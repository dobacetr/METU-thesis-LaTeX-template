\section*{WORKSHOPS}
\begingroup
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{p{\textwidth}}
	%\hangindent=0.5cm
	\textbf{Blatant Fabrications}, Co-facilitated with Nagihan Tuna, July 10, 2019, DRS Learn X Design 2019 Fifth International Conference for Design Education Researchers, in METU, Ankara. Participants provided a current design challenge, which we run through a AI text generator (Open GPT-2) and facilitated a future world-building activity based on the results.\\
	%\hangindent=0.5cm
	\textbf{Talking Things}, Co-facilitated with Nagihan Tuna, November 9, 2019, in METU, Ankara. Participants analyzed sensorial data gathered from household appliances and generated fictional personas for them to be used in potential future of smart products.\\
	%\hangindent=0.5cm
	\textbf{Collecting Use Data and Creating Design Insights by Using Design Fiction}, Co-facilitated with Nagihan Tuna, September 12, 2018, UTAK 2018 3. National Design Research Conference, in METU, Ankara. A role-playing game was developed to enable design students interview with fictional coffee machines using a conversational interface. We then explored assumptions within user personas they use in their idea generation practices.\\
